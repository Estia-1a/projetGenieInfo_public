## Image Data Structure

To manipulate image, you will have to use an 'unsigned char *' which points to the pixel data. 
The pixel data consists of HEIGHT lines of WIDTH pixels, with each pixel consisting of N components. 
In our case, we will use N = 3 for RGB components.
The first pixel pointed to is top-left-most in the image.

Data is stored in a unsigned char buffer in row-order of a (WIDTH * HEIGHT * N) size.
